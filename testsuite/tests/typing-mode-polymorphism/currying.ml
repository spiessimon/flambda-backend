(* [fst] is the K-combinator and displays an interesting bi-directional dependency
  between the curry mode, the argument, and the inner return

  Its signature should look like the following:

    val fst : 'a @ [< 'm & global] -> ('b @ 'n -> 'a @ [> 'm]) @ [> close('m)]

  Where close('m) refers to the meet between the comonadic parts of 'm and the
  monadic part 'm, taken to its dual comonadic counterpart. Note that 'm describes
  an upper bound in the argument, and a lower bound on the inner return.

  Because of partial application, the inner closure needs to be allocated somewhere. The
  default is to heap-allocate it, hence the global restriction on the first parameter.
