(* # Unboxing

   Unboxing in the reaper starts by considering the set of values whose runtime
   representation can be changed (other than by replacing fields that are never
   read by a poison value). The criterion used for this is that the value must
   have a unique allocation point for each of its uses that read from it.
   Formally, a value allocated at a given point $x$ can be unboxed if, for each
   usage $y$ of $x$ that reads from $x$ for one of the fields [Block],
   [Value_slot], [Function_slot], [Is_int], [Get_tag] or [Boxed_number], (but
   not [Call_witness] which connects the call witness which is not read at
   runtime from $x$, nor [Apply] or [Code_id_of_call_witnes] which are only read
   from call witnesses), $y$ has known sources, and the only source of $y$ is
   $x$.

   In the case where $x$ has unknown usages, we can assume any field defined in
   $x$ that is not local might be read from it. As such, as soon as $x$ has a
   non-local field other than [Call_witness], the representation of $x$ may not
   be changed. Besides, if $x$ has a local field $f$ that is read from a value
   with an unknown source, the criterion above fails as well.

   Likewise, we identify the functions whose calling convention can be changed,
   which are those where at each application point, we know the call witness.

   Once we have identified the values whose runtime representation can be
   changed, we must decide which of those to unbox. There are additionnal
   criteria for this:

   - Symbols may not be unboxed, as non-value symbols are not possible, and
   symbols may contain non-symbol non-constant values that cannot be turned into
   a symbol.

   - A closure that is indirectly called may not be unboxed, where a closure is
   considered indirectly called if, at the point of apply, we are unable to
   identify precisely which call witness is in the closure.

   - A value that is stored inside another whose representation cannot be
   changed cannot be unboxed.

   - A value which is passed as argument to, or is the return value of, a
   function whose calling convention cannot be changed, cannot be unboxed
   either.

   Once the decisions are taken, we compute the required variables for each
   value that is unboxed. For that, we simply use one variable for each field
   that has a use, or we recursively compute the variables needed if the field
   is unboxed as well.

   Likewise, for values whose representation is changed, we compute for each
   field the variables needed to represent it at the point of the allocation. *)
