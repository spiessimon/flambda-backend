(** The [Make] functor is used to generate a reduction function for
    shapes.

    It is parametrized by:
    - a function to load the shape of an external compilation unit
    - some fuel, which is used to bound recursion when dealing with recursive
      shapes introduced by recursive modules. (FTR: merlin currently uses a
      fuel of 10, which seems to be enough for most practical examples)
    - a shape lookup function, which can be used to provide shapes of type
      declarations. Always returning [None] in this function is perfectly fine.
      If shapes are provided for a [Shape.Uid.t], then reduction will insert
      this declaration during reduction and reduce further inside the
      declaration.

    Usage warning: To ensure good performances, every reduction made with the
    same instance of that functor share the same ident-based memoization tables.
    Such an instance should only be used to perform reduction inside a unique
    compilation unit to prevent conflicting entries in these memoization tables.
